# Sea Lion Prompt Lunch Reminder

![sealion](img/sealion.jpg)

Be reminded to eat lunch, directly on the command line.

Messages are displayed in configurable time-intervals.

## Quick installation

    git clone https://github.com/xyproto/sealion
    cd sealion
    sudo make install
    sealion-setup

## User setup on a system where Sea Lion is installed

    sealion-setup

## Requirements

* Python 3
* `bash`, `fish` and/or `zsh`.

## Quick enable and disable

* Type `on` or `off` to enable or disable Sea Lion for the current shell session.

## Configuration format

* `sealion.conf` needs to follow the existing format strictly (using `:` and `-` at the appropriate places) or there will be errors.
* Comments in `sealion.conf` are allowed, as long as they are single-line comments starting with `#`.
* If a description in `sealion.conf` contains `%m`, it will be replaced with the number of minutes left when outputting the message.

Example configuration file:

```
11:00 - 11:20 : lunch 11:20, in %m minutes
```

This will add a prompt reminder from 11:00 to 11:20 with the message "lunch 11:20, in N minutes", where N is the number of minutes left.

## Keeping watches in a separate terminal emulator window

Simple case:

```sh
watch sealion
```

For updating every 5 seconds, with no title and highlighting any differences:

```sh
watch --color --differences --no-title --interval 5 sealion
```

# Manual Setup

The following is not normally needed, since `sealion-setup` handles this per user, but it helps to explain what is being set up by `sealion-setup`:

### Manual Bash setup

* Add the following to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
# Sea Lion Prompt Reminder
on() {
  export PROMPT_COMMAND="/usr/bin/sealion"
  off() { unset PROMPT_COMMAND; }
}

# Enable prompt messages if on the right host and not over ssh
[ $HOSTNAME = "work_pc" ] && [ ! -n "$SSH_TTY" ] && on || true
```

* NOTE: Change `work_pc` to whatever the hostname of your work PC is.

### Manual Fish setup

* Add the following to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
# Sea Lion Prompt Reminder
function on
  function sealion --on-event fish_prompt
    /usr/bin/sealion
  end
  function off
    functions -e sealion
  end
end

# Enable prompt messages if on the right host and not over ssh
if [ (hostname) = "work_pc" ]; and not count $SSH_TTY > /dev/null; on; end
```

* NOTE: Change `work_pc` to whatever the hostname of your work PC is.

### Manual Zsh setup

* Add the following to your `~/.zshrc`:

```zsh
# Sea Lion Prompt Reminder
on() {
  precmd() { /usr/bin/sealion }
  off() { unset -f precmd }
}

# Enable prompt messages if on the right host and not over ssh
[ "$HOST" = "work_pc" ] && [ ! -n "$SSH_TTY" ] && on || true
```

* NOTE: Change `work_pc` to whatever the hostname of your work PC is.
